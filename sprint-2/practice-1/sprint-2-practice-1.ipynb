    "One way to fix this is by adding the `cetner = True` parameter in the `rolling` method, which sets window labels as the center of the window index, rather than the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to do this, which can be applied to a resampled dataframe as well, is to add a **time offset**. Pandas has an entire package that has tools to help you handle time series, and you can call it in using `import pandas.tseries.frequencies` to explore the tools within. For now, we will import only the `to_offset` method as this will help us solve our offset problem.\n",

    "The `loffset` variable should be set to **half** your window - in this case our window = 4, so we will use `loffset = '2Y'` or two years. We subtract this offset from our `Year` column, to add a new offset column. We can then use that column to produce plots that do not have the time shift caused by the resampling/rolling. "
