    "**User-Defined functions** are a powerful tool in python that allow us to create a section of code to complete a specific task which we can call & run whenever we choose in our program. Python functions are considered **objects**, which in this case simply means it is a specific method that can be called by its name. Functions take inputs called **arguments** and can **return** data output as well. \n",
